To run the game, run the start.cmd file and join the serveo.net link it will provide in the original terminal

OBSTACLES: 
  => The rock will hit any player backwards 10 spaces
  => The thorn bush will halve any players next roll
  => The swamp will cause that player to lose a turn. If both players are in the swamp, the player who entered first has their move
  => The portal swaps the positions of both players and then teleports itself somewhere random

HOW TO PLAY:
  => Players take turns moving across the board
  => Each player clicks the roll button and moves forwards the sum of the two numbers
  => Modifiers may impact the travel of players
  => Rolling a double will move the player backwards by the sum of the double (e.g. if a player rolls a double 6 they move backwards by 12 spaces)
  => The first player to reach the end of the board wins the game
